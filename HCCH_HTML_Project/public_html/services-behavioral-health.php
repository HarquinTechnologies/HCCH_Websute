                    <p>Our behavioral health program is just as pivotal as our 
                        others when it comes to overall well-being. Mental health 
                        disorders affect an estimated 22% of American adults and 
                        impact our ability to cope with everyday demands and to 
                        interact with others.

                    <p>When a patient is initially seen at Orange Blossom Family 
                        Health they are assessed for multiple needs that we may 
                        be able to address, including mental health and substance 
                        abuse issues. Behavioral health services at our health 
                        center are provided by licensed mental health counselors 
                        and a psychiatric nurse practitioner. Our team of counselors 
                        conducts mental health and substance abuse sessions, individual 
                        talk therapy, and makes referrals for detoxification and 
                        crisis centers. Our psychiatric nurse practitioner prescribes 
                        and manages medications on an on-going basis for our clients 
                        with chronic behavioral health issues. Our Health Center 
                        is an approved site for graduate level mental health interns 
                        and students. Through individualized treatment plans, our 
                        team is empowering their clients to make better choices 
                        in gaining control of their lives.

                    <br/>
                    <p>Mental illness is as serious as any "physical" illness and 
                        does not discriminate based on age, race, or income. 
                        Untreated it can result in physical disability, substance 
                        abuse, unemployment, and homelessness. With a combination 
                        of therapy and medication, the majority of people who suffer 
                        from serious mental illness have a strong chance of reduction 
                        in symptoms.
