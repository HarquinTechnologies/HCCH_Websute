                    <p>Primary Medical Care is one of the foundations of Orange 
                        Blossom Family Health. Early detection and treatment are 
                        crucial in managing disease, which is why we emphasize a 
                        preventive approach to medicine.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Our medical staff consists of a team of physicians, nurse 
                        practitioners, physician assistants, registered nurses, 
                        medical assistants, and student interns. We strive to 
                        create a "medical home" for our patients with the goal 
                        of preventing the inappropriate use of the local emergency 
                        rooms for non- emergent situations. Through the Health 
                        Disparities Collaborative, a program designed to reduce 
                        disparities in health outcomes for minority and underserved 
                        people, we use the Chronic Care model. Through health 
                        education, this model empowers the patient to take charge 
                        in managing their own health. We provide treatment and 
                        evaluation for chronic health conditions including diabetes 
                        and hypertension.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>As we provide primary medical care, we have an Orange County 
                        Referral Specialist on site. Through this program, uninsured 
                        Orange County residents who qualify are referred to secondary 
                        care providers in partnership with the Orange County Health 
                        Department.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>We also conduct a confidential rapid HIV testing program 
                        that is open to anyone from anywhere. There are no geographic 
                        or financial requirements to receive this test. We use 
                        an antibody test administered by finger stick and the test 
                        takes approximately 20 minutes to obtain a reactive or 
                        non-reactive result. If a reactive result is received, a 
                        blood sample is taken and forwarded to the Department of 
                        Health for confirmatory testing. It takes two weeks to 
                        receive status confirmation from this testing. There is 
                        no cost to the patient for the rapid HIV test performed 
                        here at our Health Center.
                    </p>
