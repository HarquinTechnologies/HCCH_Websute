                <br/>
                <p>Orange Blossom Family Health offers access to quality health 
                    care services in an atmosphere of dignity and respect for 
                    low-income housed or homeless residents of Orange, Osceola, 
                    and Seminole Counties.   Our first health center opened in 
                    2006 just west of downtown Orlando, offering medical, dental 
                    and behavioral health programs.  In addition to the many services 
                    offered at our main site, we now operate out of multiple satellite 
                    locations throughout the tri-county area providing little to no 
                    cost preventive medical care. We offer affordable patient centered 
                    services for all community members regardless of their financial 
                    status.   
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>We look forward to having you visit us at any of our locations 
                    and serving you as your health care home!  
                </p>
