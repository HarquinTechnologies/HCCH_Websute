                    <p>Another focal point of our services at Orange Blossom Family 
                        Health is our oral health program. Good oral health is part 
                        of an individual's overall well-being and also contributes 
                        to self-esteem. Studies have shown that poor oral health 
                        may be related to cardiovascular disease and can impact 
                        nutritional health as well. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Oral health services are provided by a team of dentists, 
                        hygienists, dental assistants, and students. Emergency 
                        dental care, oral screenings, cleaning services, restoration work, 
                        and referrals for surgery are some of the services provided. 
                        Low cost full or partial dentures are also available to 
                        our patients, aided in the process by our volunteer, Sister 
                        Jessica. Orange Blossom Family Health has an established 
                        pediatric dental program that benefits both children and 
                        their families by providing oral health education.
