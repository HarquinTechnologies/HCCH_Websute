                    <p>Another focal point of our services at Orange Blossom Family 
                        Health is our oral health program. Good oral health is part 
                        of an individual's overall well-being and also contributes 
                        to self-esteem. Studies have shown that poor oral health 
                        may be related to cardiovascular disease and can impact 
                        nutritional health as well. 
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Oral health services are provided by a team of dentists,
                        hygienists, dental assistants, and students. Emergency
                        dental care, oral screenings, cleaning services, 
                        restoration work, and referrals for surgery are some 
                        of the services provided, as well as low cost full or 
                        partial dentures. Orange Blossom Family Health has an 
                        established pediatric dental program that benefits both 
                        children and their families by providing oral health education.
